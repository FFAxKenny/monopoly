This is the main directory for the Container class. 

This container class contains (for now) two different implementations for containers-- a
linked list based implementation and an array based implementation. 

To switch containers, use the main makefile in this directory to switch them. Any classes that
may call in the container class will use the symbolic links that are generated by the main 
makefile in this directory.
